# ðŸš€ IBM Data Science Capstone Project: SpaceX Falcon 9 Landing Prediction

Welcome to the final project of the **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate**. This capstone project demonstrates the full data science workflow, including data acquisition, wrangling, exploratory data analysis, model building, and deployment using a real-world dataset on **SpaceX Falcon 9 launches**.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Objective

The goal of this project is to predict whether the **first stage of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will successfully land**. A successful landing is crucial to SpaceXâ€™s mission of reducing spaceflight costs through rocket reuse.

## ðŸ“Š Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Jupyter Notebooks**
- **Pandas, NumPy** for data manipulation
- **BeautifulSoup, Requests** for web scraping
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly** for data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning
- **Dash by Plotly** for building interactive dashboards
- **Watson Studio / Skills Network Labs** for development and hosting

## ðŸ§ª Key Deliverables

1. **Data Scraping**: Launch records scraped from Wikipedia and revenue data extracted via web scraping and APIs.
2. **Data Wrangling & EDA**: Cleaned and visualized data to understand patterns in successful landings.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Created dummy variables, payload features, and launch site encodings.
4. **Modeling**: Compared multiple classifiers (Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees, KNN) and selected the best-performing model.
5. **Interactive Dashboard**: Built a Dash dashboard to visualize launch success by payload, site, and other features.

## ðŸš§ Future Improvements

- Expand to include more recent Falcon 9 launch data.
- Improve prediction accuracy with ensemble models.
- Integrate real-time launch data APIs.
- Deploy the dashboard on a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, IBM Cloud).
